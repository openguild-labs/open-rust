# Fundamentals

---

## Data Types

<pba-flex center>

- Memory only stores binary data
  - Anything can be represented in binary
- Program determines what the binary represents
- Basic types that are universally useful are provided by the language

</pba-flex>

---

## Basic Data Types

- Boolean
  - true, false
- Integer
  - 1, 2, 50, 99, -2
- Double / Float
  - 1.1, 5.5, 200.0001, 2.0
- Character
  - ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘c’, ‘6’, ‘$’
- String
  - “Hello”, “string”, “this is a string”, “it’s 42”

---

## What is a variable?

- Assign data to a temporary memory location
  - Allows programmer to easily work with memory
- Can be set to any value & type
- Immutable by default, but can be mutable
  - Immutable: cannot be changed
  - Mutable: can be changed

---

## Examples

```rust
let two = 2;
let hello = "hello";
let j = 'j';
let my_half = 0.5;
let mut my_name = "Bill";
let quit_program = false;
let your_half = my_half;
```

---

## What are functions?

- A way to encapsulate program functionality
- Optionally accept data
- Optionally return data
- Utilized for code organization
  - Also makes code easier to read

---

## Anatomy of a function

```rust
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
```

---

## Using a function

```rust
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

let x = add(1, 1);
let y = add(3, 0);
let z = add(x, 1);
```

---

## The println macro

- Macros expand into additional code
- println “Prints” (displays) information to the terminal
- Useful for debugging

```rust
let life = 42;

println!("hello");
println!("{:?}", life);
println!("{:?}{:?}", life, life);
println!("the meaning is {:?}", life);

println!("{life:?}");
println!("{life}");
```

---

- Macros use an exclamation point to call/invoke
- Generate additional Rust code
- Data can be printed using println!:
  - {:?}
  - {varname:?}
