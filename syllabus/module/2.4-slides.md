## Overlapping Patterns

- Patterns easily overlap.
- Minimize number of match arms to avoid bugs

```rust
match slice {
    [first, ..] => (),
    [.., last] => (),
    [] => (),
}

```

Second arm always ignored

---

## Prevent Overlapping Patterns

- Match the largest patterns first, followed by smaller patterns

```rust
match slice {
    [] => (),
    [a, ..] => (),
    [a, b, ..] => (),
    [a, b, c, ..] => (),
    [a, b, c, d, ..] => (),
}
// "First two arms cover all cases, remaining will be ignored"
match slice {
    [a, b, c, d, ..] => (),
    [a, b, c, ..] => (),
    [a, b, ..] => (),
    [a, ..] => (),
    [] => (),
}
// "All arms can be matched"

```

---

## Guards

```rust
let nums = vec![7, 8, 9];
match nums.as_slice() {
    [first @ 1..=3, rest @ ..] => {
        // 'first' is always 1, 2 or 3
        // 'rest' is the remaining slice
    },
    [single] if single == &5 || single == &6 => (),
    [a, b] => (),
    [..] => (),
    [] => (),
}
```

---

## Typestates Patterns

- Leverage type system to encode state changes
- Implemented by creating a type for each state
  - Use move semantics to invalidate a state
  - Return next state from previous state
  - Optionally drop the state
    - Close file, connection dropped, etc
  - Compile time enforcement of logic

---

## Example

```rust
struct BusTicket;
struct BoardedBusTicket;

impl BusTicket {
    fn board(self) -> BoardedBusTicket {
        BoardedBusTicket
    }
}

let ticket = BusTicket;
let boarded = ticket.board();

// Compile error
ticket.board();
```

---

## Example

```rust
struct File<'a>(&'a str);

impl<'a> File<'a> {
    fn read_bytes(&self) -> Vec<u8> {
        // ... read data ...
    }

    fn delete(self) {
        // ... delete file ...
    }
}

let file = File("data.txt");
let data = file.read_bytes();
file.delete();

// Compile error
let read_again = file.read_bytes();

```
