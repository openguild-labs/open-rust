# Common Data Structures

---

## Enumeration

- Data that can be one of multiple different possibilities
  - Each possibility is called a “variant”
- Provides information about your program to the compiler
  - More robust programs

---

## Example

```rust
enum Direction {
    Up,
    Down,
    Left,
    Right,
}

fn which_way(go: Direction) -> &'static str {
    match go {
        Direction::Up => "up",
        Direction::Down => "down",
        Direction::Left => "left",
        Direction::Right => "right",
    }
}
```

---

## Structure

- A type that contains multiple pieces of data
  - All or nothing – cannot have some pieces of data and not others
- Each piece of data is called a “field”
- Makes working with data easier
  - Similar data can be grouped together

---

## Example

```rust
struct ShippingBox {
    depth: i32,
    width: i32,
    height: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let my_box = ShippingBox {
        depth: 3,
        width: 2,
        height: 5,
    };

    let tall = my_box.height;
    println!("the box is {:?} units tall", tall);
}
```

---

## Tuples

- A type of “record”
- Store data anonymously
  - No need to name fields
- Useful to return pairs of data from functions
- Can be “destructured” easily into variables

---

## Example

```rust
enum Access {
    Full,
}

fn one_two_three() -> (i32, i32, i32) {
    (1, 2, 3)
}

fn main() {
    let numbers = one_two_three();
    let (x, y, z) = one_two_three();
    println!("{:?}, {:?}", x, numbers.0); // 1
    println!("{:?}, {:?}", y, numbers.1); // 2
    println!("{:?}, {:?}", z, numbers.2); // 3

    let (employee, access) = ("Jake", Access::Full);
}
```

---

## Expressions

- Rust is an expression-based language
  - Most things are evaluated and return some value
- Expression values coalesce to a single point
  - Can be used for nesting logic

---

## Example

```rust
let my_num = 3;
let is_lt_5 = if my_num < 5 {
    true
} else {
    false
};

let is_lt_5 = my_num < 5;
```

---

## Example

```rust
let my_num = 3;
let message = match my_num {
    1 => "hello",
    _ => "goodbye"
};
```

---

## Example

```rust
enum Menu {
    Burger,
    Fries,
    Drink,
}

let paid = true;
let item = Menu::Drink;
let drink_type = "water";
let order_placed = match item {
    Menu::Drink => {
        if drink_type == "water" {
            true
        } else {
            false
        }
    },
    _ => true,
};

```
